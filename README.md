# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Running the Application Locally

To run the application on your local machine, follow these steps:

1.  **Install dependencies:**
    If you haven't already, install the project dependencies using npm (or yarn/pnpm):
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    # or
    # pnpm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**
    Start the Next.js development server using the following command:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    # or
    # pnpm dev
    ```
    This command usually starts the server on `http://localhost:9002` (as specified in the `package.json` script).

3.  **Open the application:**
    Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:9002`.

The application utilizes Next.js, which dynamically renders pages. There isn't a static HTML file to open directly; you need to run the development server to view the application.
